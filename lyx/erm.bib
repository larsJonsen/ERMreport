  abstract = {The growing availability of online journal literature and the license
	agreements that make such literature useable in an academic environment
	present educators opportunities for using journal articles in online
	teaching. The use of online journal articles avoids logistical challenges
	associated with the use of printed copies of journal articles, particularly
	when assembling course packs. Technological developments have improved
	the reliability of linking to journal articles via the World Wide
	Web. Three linking methods are described: persistent linking services
	available in online databases and journal collections; the digital
	object identifier (DOI), and OpenURL. Faculty who wish to reliably
	integrate links to journal articles in online instruction should
	be familiar with these linking methods.},
